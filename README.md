# Re-Cycle
Here are examples of my work on the user account registration and login, along with the shop and product details page.
The website is currently pending launch.

Re-Cycle is a marketplace platform for individuals to sell their new or useds bicycles, to ultimately reduce waste and recycle products that would otherwise be obsoleted and destroyed.

I was tasked with working on the login and registration portal, product landing page and product details pages.
This consisted of a Front-End utilizing React and Redux, and a .NET Core backend with a SQL Database.

# Visual Database Layout
I created this chart for the team of developers to ensure we had an active and updateable visual layout of our SQL Database. Each line signifies the foreign key relationship between each table.
