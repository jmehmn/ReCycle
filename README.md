# ReCycle
Here are examples of my work on the user account creation, management and authorization on the e-commerce web application for the startup company Re-Cycle.

The website allows for the registration of accounts for customers looking to purchase bicycles, or to sell them, with the hopes of eliminating the waste produced by used bicycles.

In these examples, you will find the Login and Registration forms where I was responsible for handling the form Validation, 
email confirmation, and salting and hashing password cryptography utilizing the bCrypt library and T-SQL.
